# resize CS50/pset 4

Resize is a program that enlarges 24-bit uncompressed BMPs by a factor of n.

In this task I had to find out how BMP file is constructed 
and how it can be enlarged pixel by pixel.

I had distribution code that simply copies BMP image (copy.c) and I modified it in such a way 
that it enlarges the image by n in resize.c.

In repository there are smiley.bmp and its enlarged copy large.bmp.
